    <h2>About Titanic</h2>
    <p>
      The Titanic was a British passenger ship that sank in the Atlantic Ocean on April 14–15, 1912, during its maiden
      voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, killing about 1,500 people. The sinking stands as one of the
      most famous tragedies in modern history, inspiring numerous stories, films, a musical, and much scholarship and
      scientific speculation.

      In the early 1900s, the transatlantic passenger trade was highly competitive. The White Star and Cunard lines vied
      to transport wealthy travelers and immigrants. After Cunard debuted two new ships, the Lusitania and the
      Mauretania, White Star chairman J. Bruce Ismay planned to build a class of large liners known for their comfort
      instead of their speed. Ultimately, three vessels were constructed: the Olympic, the Titanic, and the Britannic.
      The Titanic had 16 compartments with doors that could be closed from the bridge to contain water if the hull was
      breached. The ship's builders claimed that four of the compartments could be flooded without endangering the
      liner’s buoyancy, leading many to call the Titanic unsinkable.
