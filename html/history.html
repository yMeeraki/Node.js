    <h2>History of Titanic</h2>
    <p>
      The R.M.S. Titanic is perhaps the most famous shipwreck in our current popular culture. Titanic was a
      British-registered ship in the White Star line that was owned by a U.S. company in which famed American financier
      John Pierpont "JP" Morgan was a major stockholder. Titanic was built in Belfast, Northern Ireland by Harland &
      Wolff for transatlantic passage between Southampton, England and New York City. It was the largest and most
      luxurious passenger ship of its time and was reported to be unsinkable. Titanic, launched on May 31, 1911, and set
      sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton on April 10, 1912, with 2,240 passengers and crew on board. On April
      15, 1912, after striking an iceberg, Titanic broke apart and sank to the bottom of the ocean, taking with it the
      lives of more than 1,500 passengers and crew.

      In the early 1900s the transatlantic passenger trade was highly profitable and competitive, with ship lines vying
      to transport wealthy travelers and immigrants. Two of the chief lines were White Star and Cunard. By the summer of
      1907, Cunard seemed poised to increase its share of the market with the debut of two new ships, the Lusitania and
      the Mauretania, which were scheduled to enter service later that year. The two passenger liners were garnering
      much attention for their expected speed; both would later set speed records crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Looking
      to answer his rival, White Star chairman J. Bruce Ismay reportedly met with William Pirrie, who controlled the
      Belfast shipbuilding firm Harland and Wolff, which constructed most of White Star’s vessels. The two men devised a
      plan to build a class of large liners that would be known for their comfort instead of their speed. It was
      eventually decided that three vessels would be constructed: the Olympic, the Titanic, and the Britannic.
