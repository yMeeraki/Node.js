      Titanic was launched on May 31, 1911, and set sail on its maiden voyage from Southampton on April 10, 1912, with
      2,240 passengers and crew on board. On April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg, Titanic broke apart and sank to
      the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, taking with it more than 1,500 passengers and crew. While there has been
      some salvage outside of the major hull portions, most of the ship remains in its final resting place, 12,000 feet
      below sea level and over 350 nautical miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Its famous story of disaster
      and human drama has been, and continues to be, recounted in numerous books, articles, and movies. Titanic has been
      recognized by the United States for its national and international significance and in many ways has become a
      cultural icon around the world. The disaster resulted in a number of memorials around the world. In the United
